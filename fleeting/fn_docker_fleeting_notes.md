## MicroBadger

Not specifically for managing containers but for analyzing images, [MicroBadger](https://microbadger.com/) digs into image files to show the layers and commands within them, their dependencies, and their impact on your application.

## Rancher

While the tools I've mentioned so far are more designed for getting started with Docker images and containers, [Rancher](http://rancher.com/rancher) is a tool that takes what's possible with a Docker GUI further and is more useful for production clusters. Reflecting this focus on production, Rancher is designed to work on Linux machines, so to test locally you might need to install onto a Virtual Machine.
