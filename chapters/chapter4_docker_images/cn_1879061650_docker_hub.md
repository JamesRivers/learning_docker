# docker hub - home of images
Requirements ⚓ you have docker installed and have run containers.
Learning AIM 🎯 to get you up to speed on docker hub and how to use it
- Basics of Docker Hub (hub.docker.com)
- Find Official and other good public images 
- Download images and basics of image tags

## official images
official images from companies will be listed in docker hub with a `single` name and an offical marker. 

### versions 
great, the images have versions or rather tags.  take note of the tags and what environment that support, `arm64` `amd64` etc...  

remember to use tags in the images you list in the docker commands, no tag = `latest` that is not always a good idea - is it stable?

## Other good public images
rule of thumb never download anything you are not sure about.... end!
Howver if there is another image that is not offical but has a number of downloads in the 1000's or milliions, it is not guarenteed to be ok, but all those people can't be wrong can they?
