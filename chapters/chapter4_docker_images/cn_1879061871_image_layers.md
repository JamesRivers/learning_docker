A hisgtory of the image layers. 

Base layer is known as `scratch`, changes are then added on top. 

This Dockerfile contains four commands. Commands that modify the filesystem create a layer. TheFROM statement starts out by creating a layer from the ubuntu:18.04 image. The LABEL command only modifies the image‚Äôs metadata, and does not produce a new layer. The COPY command adds some files from your Docker client‚Äôs current directory. The first RUN command builds your application using the make command, and writes the result to a new layer. The second RUN command removes a cache directory, and writes the result to a new layer. Finally, the CMD instruction specifies what command to run within the container, which only modifies the image‚Äôs metadata, which does not produce an image layer.

Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. Note that both adding, and removing files will result in a new layer. In the example above, the $HOME/.cache directory is removed, but will still be available in the previous layer and add up to the image‚Äôs total size. Refer to the Best practices for writing Dockerfiles and use multi-stage builds sections to learn how to optimize your Dockerfiles for efficient images.

The layers are stacked on top of each other. When you create a new container, you add a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. This layer is often called the ‚Äúcontainer layer‚Äù. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer. The diagram below shows a container based on an ubuntu:15.04 image.

to recap 
 - Images are made up of file system changes and metadata
- Each layer is uniquely identified and only stored once on a host
-  This saves storage space on host and transfer time on push/pull
-  A container is just a single read/write layer on top of image
-  docker image history and inspect commands can teach us
