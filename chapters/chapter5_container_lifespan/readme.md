# Chapter 5 Persistant Data ...
ðŸŽ¯ We aim to cover 
- Defining the problem of persistent data
- Key concepts with containers: immutable, ephemeral
- Learning and using Data Volumes
- Learning and using Bind Mounts
- Assignments

Containers are usually immutable and ephemeral ... 

> immutable - unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
> ephemeral - lasting for a very short time.

-  "immutable infrastructure": only re-deploy containers, never change
-  This is the ideal scenario, but what about databases, or unique
data?
- Docker gives us features to ensure these "separation of concerns"
-  This is known as "persistent data"
-  Two ways: Volumes and Bind Mounts
	-  Volumes: make special location outside of container UFS
	-  Bind Mounts: link container path to host path
