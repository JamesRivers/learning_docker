# Chapter 1 - Docker Overview

Start here to begin your docker journey.  

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### You need ...
Going forward in this course you will need a system to install and learn how to use Docker and containers.  Here are some suggestions for you:
- deploy on `Linode`, build a linux VM and instal docker - spin up spin down as you need.  Could be `AWS` or `GCP` you get the picture. 
- deploy local on your host machine - `docker desktop` on mac and windows. 
- deploy local on your machine - native linux users just need to install docker. 
- deploy via local linux vm, deploy a linux VM then install docker there
- use free onlne tools like play-with-docker.  

We cover how to get docker installed in the next chapter!
