# Chapter 3 - Getting Started
Now you have docker installed we are going to get started on containers. 

## Modules 
- Verify that the docker client can connect to the docker engine. The best way I find is to use the `docker version` - should show the client and server version. [[../../reference/rn_1891642427_docker_version]]
- Obtain a set of information from docker with `docker info` to make sure that you are happy that the docker engine is set up in the manner you expect. [[../../reference/rn_1891646561_docker_info]]
- Get a full list of all the docker commands that you could ever possibly need. [[../../reference/rn_1891647410_docker_commands]]
- Start our first container ... [[cn_1879038510_simple_web_server](cn_1879038510_simple_web_server.md)]
