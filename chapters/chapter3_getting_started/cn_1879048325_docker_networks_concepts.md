# docker networks
Requirements ‚öì - know how to start a container, plus under the TCP/IP stack, subnets, firewalls etc... 
Learning AIM üéØ 
- cover docker ports
- docker port checking 
- concepts of docker networks  and docker networking 
- docker network diagram overview

## docker network defaults
- Each container connected to a private virtual network "bridge"
- Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
- All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without -p
- Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app: 
	- network "my_web_app" or mysql and php/apache container
	- network "my_api" for mongo and nodejs containers

- "Batteries Included, But Removable"
	- Defaults work well in many cases, but easy to swap out parts to customize it
-Make new virtual networks
- Attach containers to more then one virtual network (or none) 
- Skip virtual networks and use host IP (--net=host)
	- [docs.docker --net](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/networkingcontainers/)
	-  Use different Docker network drivers to gain new abilities
		-  and much more...

Exercise ü§∏ - start a new container and will pay special attention to the `--publish` command.  `docker container run -p 80:80 --name webserver -d nginx`

Notes üóí  always remeber the publishing command is HOST PORT : CONTAINER PORT format. 

Use a new command `docker container port`  this will show the container port mapping and sources. 
```bash
‚ûú docker container port de
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:80
```

What is the IP address of the container? The same as the host IP address? Yes and no. Docker has assigned a virtual IP to the container that we can see via the `docker container inspect`  lets check it out...

I know that the detail I am looking for is under `NetworkSettings` so I am going to use the `--format` option.  Note `de` is the ID of the container
```bash
‚ùØ docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' de
172.17.0.2
``` 
there we go the docker virtual ip for this container is 1`72.17.0.2`
