# Exercise - manage multiple containers
Learning AIM üéØ - how to create and start multiple containers.

You are going to build and manage multiple containers.  Here is what you need to deploy:
- nginx 
- mysql 
- httpd (apache) server

Ports, nginx needs to listen on port 80 so that would be 80:80, httpd needs to listen on port 80 also, but we are alreday using 80 on nginx, so map httpd as 8080:80, host on 8080 mapped to container port 80.  MySQL will listen on the default 3306 tcp port.  These cotainers are not talking to each other yet... We just need to get them started to get the pratice.

üß†  remember docs.docker.com and --help are your best friends... Use them!

 üóí Tips! - use `--detach` `-d` and get into the habit of using `--name` to name your containers. 
 
 An item we haven't reviewed yet is the `env` options. If we pass `--env` or `-e` we can pass environment variables to the container, this is a common practice. For example `-e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes`.  Set this and try and discover the root password by using the `docker logs` command. 
 
 Once you have completed the exercise clean up the mess. 
 
 Try not to peek at the steps as to how I would do it below...
